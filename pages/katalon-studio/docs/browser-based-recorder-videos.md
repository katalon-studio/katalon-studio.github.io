You can record and watch videos to see what went wrong with failed tests.  
> Notes
> * You can only record videos for Web UI testing.

Katalon Studio version **7.8 onwards** supports [screen-based recording](katalon-studio/docs/record-screen-based-videos.html) and browser-based recording. Screen-based recording allows you to see tests run in a local machine while browser-based recording enables you to see tests run in console mode.

> **Requirements:**
 >
 > * An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license.
 > * Katalon Studio version 7.8 onwards.

You can use browser-based recording feature to:  

* **Record video of browser window only** (even if it's hidden behind another window).
 * **Record video of Headless browser**.

    Headless Browser is a way to run browsers in a headless environment, popularly used for test automation and browser testing in CI/CD pipeline when you don't need a visible GUI. You can learn more about Headless Browser Execution in this [manual](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/headless-browsers-execution.html).
* **Record videos of multiple browsers simultaneously** (for instance, parallel execution of Test Suite Collection).

> Notes:
 > * This feature is available for Chrome, Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), and [Headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome). 
> * This feature supports Test Suite and Test Suite Collection execution.

To use browser-based recording feature, you need to enable it in Katalon Studio and install a third-party library (FFmpeg) for video encoding.

## Enable Browser-based Recorder in Katalon Studio

1. Go to **Project** > **Settings** > **Execution** to open the Execution view.
2. In the **During Execution Options** panel, enable Video Recorder by checking **Record Video during execution**.
   > The Browser-based Video  Recorder function only records failed test cases by default.
3. Set a window size of 1500x1000 for the browser you record in Project Settings.
* Go to **Project** > **Settings** > **Desired Capabilities** > **Web UI**. Select **Chrome** or **Chrome Headless** or **Edge Chromium**.

### For Docker Image

Katalon Docker Image could be used as a container to execute Katalon Studio tests and write reports to the host's file system.

Currently, Katalon Docker Image doesnâ€™t include FFmpeg library. You can build your own image by following these steps:
1. Create a docker image file with this content:

   ```groovy
   FROM katalonstudio/katalon
   RUN apt-get -y update
   RUN apt-get install -y ffmpeg
   ```

2. Build your own image. Eg:

   ```groovy
   docker build -t mybuild .
   ```

3. Run your docker with Katalon script. Eg:

   ```groovy
   docker run -t --rm -v "$(pwd)":/tmp/project mybuild katalonc.sh -projectPath=/tmp/project - 
   browserType="Chrome" -retry=0 -statusDelay=15 -testSuitePath="Test Suites/TS_RegressionTest"

## View recorded videos

 After running the test suite, navigate to the **Result** tab. You can see a list of test cases. A recorded video is attached to each test case accordingly.

Click on the *Play* icon in the **Video** column to play the video.

Each test step in a video has a description embedded like a subtitle.
